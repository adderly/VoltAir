/**
 * @ingroup Engine
 * @ingroup QQuickItem
 * @brief Ui module for gaining basic input event (i.e. keyboard) support on non-Android devices.
 *
 * On non-Android devices, this item, when given focus or along a focused path in the Qml item tree,
 * intercepts QKeyEvent%s, converts them into their associated ControllerEvent%s, and passes them
 * to the KeyboardManager for handling.
 * @note InputArea must ignore QKeyEvent%s on Android, and instead handle them separately in
 * AndroidActivity. The problem is Qt translates sequences of Android @c MotionEvent%s occasionally
 * into QKeyEvent%s that are difficult to correlate due to lack of device Id on QEvent%s. As
 * a result, even though a gamepad-related controller was spawned for the Android @c MotionEvent%s
 * in AndroidActivity, we would end up spawning a second keyboard-related controller for the Qt
 * system's translated QKeyEvent if we did not ignore the QKeyEvent%s on Android.
 * Thus, the full solution adopted here and in AndroidActivity is, on Android, to not let InputArea
 * spawn controllers (i.e. route events to ControllerManager%s). Instead, AndroidActivity captures
 * all input events (both @c KeyEvent%s and @c MotionEvent%s), translating and routing them
 * appropriately. However, we leave the InputArea code to do translation for other non-Android
 * platforms.
